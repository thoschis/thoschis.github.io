Good day, all you hosers. Get our album, eh? It's titled Bob & Doug McKenzie, eh? So, go down to your local record shop (or CD shop now), and buy it. Then go to track 13 and You Are Our Guest.

You Are Our Guest. G'day, and...

Coo roo coo coo, coo coo coo coo
Bob:
Oh, sorry...
Doug:
Coo roo coo coo, coo coo coo coo
Bob:
Sorry. So g'day. Welcome to You Are Our Guest.
Doug:
It's a new show, eh? And like it was my idea.
Bob:
Aw, take off! Okay, so I'm Bob McKenzie, this is my brother Doug.
Doug:
How's it going, eh?
Bob:
Okay, so what you do is, you take the album where it's got this written down, eh? You follow it along and You Are Our Guest.
SFX:
Chair.
Bob:
And like, there's even a chair here for you.
Doug:
But like, there's no one in it, eh? So like you're not really our guest, eh?
Bob:
Geez hosehead, will you stop blowing everything?
Doug:
Okay, eh?
Bob:
Okay, so g'day! C'mon up here, sit down. Welcome.
SFX:
Sitting in chair.
YOU:
G'day, how's it going?
Bob:
Pretty good. So this is the first on the show, eh?
Bob:
You're not nervous, eh?
YOU:
No Bob, I'm pretty comfortable.
Bob:
Can I get you a beer, or back bacon?
YOU:
No thanks Bob, I just ate. Say, you guys like my toque?
Bob:
Yeah, it's a beauty.
YOU:
Doug, don't you like my toque?
  (PAUSE)
Bob:
Hey, hoser...
Doug:
What?
Bob:
Our guest asked you a question.
Doug:
There's nobody here but me and you hosehead.
YOU:
Excuse me, can I say something?
Doug:
What?
Bob:
Oh so now you're talking to our guest, eh hoser?
Doug:
Okay, but only cuz he tricked me, eh?
YOU:
Listen you hosers, the only reason I came on this show was to tell you guys that the idea of having me as your guest is stolen.
Bob:
It was his idea.
Doug:
Take off, it was not!
YOU:
Look, I don't care which one of you hosers ripped it off but it's been done before. On other albums, on TV shows. And all you've proven by doing this is that you're a couple of hosers.
Bob:
Yeah, well you're a hoser for going along with it this far.
Doug:
Yeah, and because like you're doing it with us that makes you a theif too, eh?
YOU:
Take off! I am not!
Bob:
Yeah, well you take off!
YOU:
Okay hosers, that does it. I'm never coming on this show again. You guys deserve each other. But you don't deserve me! G'day!
SFX:
Chair and footsteps.
Bob:
Wait! Give us one more chance.
YOU:
Take off!
SFX:
Door slam.
Doug:
Oh, nice going. Look what you did!
Bob:
What I did? You did it! You stole the idea.
Doug:
No, I thought of it too, eh! It must have been like a coincidence. You want me to go get your guest back?
Bob:
Forget it.

Doug
Ok, now it's May, and, like... uh... what's our topic?
Bob
Um... What happens in May?
Doug
Uh... May 4th?
Bob
There's nothing on May 4th, you hoser!
Doug
Yeah, "May the Fourth be with you!"
Bob
Oh, geez... You're a hoser!
Doug
Want to hear my Darth Vader impression?
Bob
No, I'm sure our readers have heard it many times, hoser.
Doug
Ok. I just remembered what else is in May.
Bob
What's that? Oh! I know now!
Together
MAY TWO-FOUR!
Doug
Ok, we get a holiday up here in the Great White North in May, and it's called May Two-Four.
Bob
And, like, some years, it's on May 24th.
Doug
But not always. This year it's on the 18th. So, like, what's that mean?
Bob
Um... We can only drink 18 beers each, instead of a case, which is 24.
Doug
Geez... forget about May Two-Four. I drink more than that on most days, eh?
Bob
Yeah, like maybe 36 is a lot, eh?
Doug
Take off!
Bob	Okay, good day, and welcome to the Hoser.
Doug	Good day, eh?
Bob	Okay. Like, holy geez. We've been writing The Hoser for one year now.
Doug	Jeepers. One year?
Bob	Yeah. I can't believe how long that is, eh?
Doug	Yeah. Put it in perspective...
Bob	"Perspective", eh? Like, you're using big words now, eh, hoser?
Doug	Yeah. As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, put it in perspective. That's like... a case a day, for 365 days. Um...
Bob	You can use big words but you can't do math, eh?
Doug	Hose off, eh? That's a lot of beers, anyway.
Bob	Yeah, and a lot of back bacon, too.
Doug	365 cases of beer.
Bob	Wha?
Doug	A case a day for 365 days. That's 365 cases of beer.
Bob	Right. Hoser. Anyway, we've written 12 Hosers now, and since there's a lot of readers, we'll keep writing, like forever, eh?
Doug	Or until our beer runs out.
Bob	Yeah. Ok, so that's The Hoser for this month, good day.
Doug	That's it?
Bob	Yeah. We've written a year of Hosers, and this is the anniversary issue.
Doug	Well, I thought it'd be longer.
Bob	I don't hear you offering any ideas.
Doug	Okay. We wrote for a year of beer and a year of back bacon, but you forgot donuts. You could've got me a dozen donuts, and I'd have one for each issue we wrote. Or you could've gone to the donut shop where they give you the 13th donut free, and I could have one for this issue, too.
Bob	Aw, take off!
Bob	Okay, good day, and welcome to the Hoser.
Doug	Good day, eh?
Bob	Ok, it's Christmastime in the Great White North this month.
Doug	Yeah. Merry Christmas.
Bob	Aw! Leave me hanging!
Doug	Huh?
Bob	Anyway, it's cold out this time of year, and it's snowing, eh?
Doug	Yeah, time to get out your parka, and go out in the woods to cut down your tree, eh?
Bob	Yeah. We went out yesterday to get our tree.
Doug	Well, I went to get the tree. You just came for the beer.
Bob	Get out! I helped, too.
Doug	What, by making the back bacon we had for breakfast?! Mine was burned, anyway.
Bob	No way, eh? I also picked out the tree. It was a beauty, eh?
Doug	Too bad the van set it on fire, eh?
Bob	Yeah, too bad. Then we found another good one, and cut it down.
Doug	It was a beauty. It was too big to fit in the van with all the beer in there, though.
Bob	Yeah, so we had to drink it all before putting the tree in back. All 12 cases worth.
Doug	Too bad we were too drunk to go home.
Bob	I like camping in the woods, though.
Doug	Me too, but not in December in the Great White North. It's too cold, eh?
Bob	Yeah, and then when you woke up, you took a leak on the tree we cut down.
Doug	But you took a leak on my sleeping bag, eh?!
Bob	Take off, you hoser!
Bob	Okay, good day, welcome to the Hoser.
Doug	How's it goin', eh?
Bob	Today the topic is...
Doug	Snowplows!
Bob	Wha? Get out! Snowplows. The real topic is, uh, breakfast.
Doug	I want snowplows.
Bob	No, you don't. Ok, breakfast. What do we say about it?
Doug	They go down the street, eh? And if you parked the van at the side of the road, you're not getting it out 'till May.
Bob	You're still talking about that, eh?
Doug	I'm doing snowplows. You can do whatever topic you want, but people will listen to me, eh?
Bob	They will not. Besides, we've done snowplows before.
Doug	Hoser.
Bob	Ok, as I was saying, sometimes you get up before noon, eh?
Doug	Then you look out the window and see the snowplow block in the van.
Bob	Take off! You wake up early, and you can't eat lunch, so what do you do?
Doug	Get the shovel out and start shoveling.
Bob	Yeah, exactly. You get out some cereal and shovel it in, eh? But, like, what happens when you're out of milk?
Doug	Nothing, cause you don't need milk to dig out your van.
Bob	No, you use beer, instead.
Doug	Aw! Beer on cereal? That doesn't sound very tasty, eh?
Bob	Oh, so you're doing my topic now, eh?
Doug	Huh? No! Only 'cause you tricked me, eh?
Bob	Did not.
Doug	Did too.
Bob	You tricked yourself.
Doug	Hoser.
Bob	Ok, so, when you wake up early, like maybe you weren't out at the donut place at 3 am or something...
Doug	That's when the snowplows go by, too.
Bob	...and you get hungry, and you're out of milk for your cereal, you just use beer. Or lite beer, if you use skim milk.
Doug	Or like maybe you want to drink some coffee, so you use ice beer instead of cream.
Bob	Beauty. You're doing my topic again.
Doug	Take off!
Bob	You take off! Anyway, whatever way you do it, have some beer for breakfast. Then you'll be ready to shovel out the van.
Doug	SNORK! Now you're doing my topic!
Bob	Take off!
Bob	Okay, good day, welcome to the Hoser.
Doug	Howzit goin', eh?
Bob	Okay. Last month, we did "How To Speak Canadian", eh?
Doug	Yeah, cause it's a real language, and we speak it.
Bob	It sounds like English, but it's not. Okay, go, hoser.
Doug	Where did we leave off last time?
Bob	Uh, I believe you were explaining how the Canadian heritage, landscape, and economy have all contributed to the shaping of our language.
Doug	Take off, eh? You're trying to hose me by making me look dumb!
Bob	That's not too hard, eh?
Doug	Okay, then! Fine! You can do the rest of the topic in French!
Bob	Oh, beauty! For those of you who are from, like, France, French is Canada's other official language.
Doug	Beauty one. France. French. Neat.
Bob	Yeah, well, sometimes we combine the two. Give an example, Doug.
Doug	Bonjour, eh? Welcome to Canada!
You	That was almost all English, Doug.
Doug	No, the only words in English were "welcome" and "to", eh?
Bob	Nice. Okay. Canadian words. We already said "beauty" and "eh?", but what about others?
Doug	Others?
Bob	Yeah, like "chesterfield".
Doug	Okay, folks. A chesterfield is a field owned by a guy named Chester. SNORK!
You	No it isn't, Doug. A chesterfield is a couch!
Bob	Yeah, even our readers think you're a dummy.
Doug	Take off. Okay, a chesterfield is a couch, or sofa, if you will.
Bob	Okay, more words. "Puck".
Doug	I thought you said we don't say those words on TV or the internet.
Bob	No, you're thinking of something else. I meant a hockey puck.
Doug	Oh, you should've said so, eh? We've got lots of words from hockey, cause hockey's our national sport, eh?
Bob	Our national winter sport.
Doug	What's the summer sport?
Bob	Uh. Curling, I think.
You	Take off, Bob! It's lacrosse!
Bob	Lacrosse? We've finished the French part of the topic, eh?
Doug	No, it's a real game. There's a team in Toronto, eh?
Bob	Where's the other teams?
Doug	Somewhere in the States.
Bob	Well, that's Cheez Whiz! How come it's our official summer sport, but we've got only one team!
Doug	Someone goofed. Weren't we talking about hockey?
Bob	Yeah, until the reader confused us with lacrosse, eh?
Doug	Yeah, reader! Take off!
You	Ok, but then no one will be reading The Hoser.
Bob	No, wait! Come back!
You	Only if you promise not to tell me to take off again.
Bob	Ok. Deal.
Doug	Good. There's lots of words in Canadian from hockey. I don't think there's too many from lacrosse, though.
Bob	Yeah, like "puck" and "faceoff" and "slapshot" and "centre ice".
Doug	"Centre ice", not "the neutral zone", eh?
Bob	Beauty! Explain these words to our non-Canadian readers.
Doug	Okay, a "puck" is a thick but small disc that really hurts when you get hit in the face by one when you're not wearing a mask.
Bob	Yeah, next time I'll wear a mask when I play goalie.
Doug	There's another word, "goalie". He's the guy who sits in the net, and blocks all the pucks from going in.
Bob	We wear lots of padding, eh? And have a big stick, so we can block the puck, and hit other players harder.
Doug	Yeah. Remember the game we played with the guys at the looney bin?
Bob	That was 17 years ago!
Doug	And about 17 000 beers ago. Remember my Darth Vader impression?
You	Everyone remembers that, Doug.
Doug	Ok, then there's no need to do it now.
Bob	Good.
Doug	Are we done?
Bob	No, we didn't mention pronounciation!
Doug	Oh, sorry. We don't pronounce it "aboot". Good day.
You	Good day, eh?
Bob	No, we're still not done! What aboot... uh, about spelling, eh?
Doug	What about it? Colour has a "u", centre ends with "re", not "er", which I believe is a TV show, and you put "tires" on the van, not "tyres".
Bob	Beauty. Now we're done.
You	GOOD!
Doug	Hey! Take off!
You	Don't mind if I do!
Bob	Okay, now look what you did. All our readers have left.
Doug	That's okay. They'll be back! They always come back!
Bob	Sounds like an Oscar winning performance.
Doug	In Canada, they hand out Genie awards for acting.
Bob	Well, neither of us our going to get one.
Doug	Probably not.
Bob	Okay, if there's any readers left, good day.
Doug	Good day, eh?
You	Good day, eh?
Doug	Are you still here? We're done, you can leave now. Get out! Take off!
You	You guys take off, eh?
Bob	Okay, good day, welcome to the Hoser.
Doug	Howzit goin', eh?
Bob	Today the topic is the Canadian language.
Doug	Yeah, people think that Canadians speak English. But, like, we don't, eh?
Bob	Yeah, it's like a dialect, eh? It sounds like English, and you can probably understand us if you're not from the Great White North. But we're not speaking English.
Doug	Neat, eh? Go, hoser.
Bob	There's a good one. Canadians are real polite, eh? So when you want to insult a guy without swearing or something, just call him a "hoser".
Doug	And we say "take off" instead of other things.
Bob	Well, we say that when we're on TV or movies or internet.
Doug	Yeah, well, I'll have to wash your mouth out with soap later.
Bob	Take off! I mean...
Doug	Oh, good example of the common usage, eh?
Bob	Beauty.
Doug	There's another one.
Bob	Wha? Oh. "Beauty" is another word we use.
Doug	What's it mean?
Bob	Uh. I'm not sure, but it's neat. Repeat after me, folks. Say "beauty".
You	Beauty.
Bob	Ok, I knew you could.
Doug	Suddenly this has become "You Are Our Guest, Part II".
Bob	Yeah, we got the readers to say "beauty".
Doug	Ok, I've got one! Look under there, eh?
You	Under where, Doug?
Doug	SNORK! I just got you to say "underwear"!
Bob	Geez. How old are you?
Doug	Old enough to drink, that's all I know.
Bob	Yeah, right. What else do Canadians say?
Doug	Eh?
Bob	I said, what else do Canadians say?
Doug	I heard you. I say "eh?"
Bob	Eh? Oh, eh?!
Doug	Yeah. You may have noticed that we occasionally insert the word "eh?" at the end of our sentences, eh?
You	Occasionally, Doug?
Doug	Ok, maybe it's more than that, eh? Um...
Bob	Yeah, but what does it mean?
Doug	Uh, it's like "beauty", it's neat.
Bob	Take off. It has to have a meaning, otherwise we wouldn't say it.
Doug	Ok, well, maybe it means "my brother is a hoser." Then when I say "take off, eh?" I'm really saying "take off, my brother is a hoser".
Bob	Could be, eh?
Doug	Take off. Eh?
Bob	Ok, maybe it means whatever you think it means.
Doug	So, take it in context, eh?
Bob	Ok. So what you meant was "take it in context, do you know what I mean?"
Doug	Yeah, that's the English way of saying that. The Canadian way uses less syllables.
Bob	And with the price of gas the way it is, we need to save energy by using words with less syllables, eh?
Doug	Good one.
Bob	Yeah. From now on, I'll talk with monosyllabic words.
You	"Monosyllabic" has more than one syllable, Bob.
Bob	Are you still here?
Doug	Take off! Don't make him leave!
Bob	Ok. Sorry.
You	No way, you hosers. You're out of space for this month, eh?
Doug	Hey, he's right.
Bob	Yep. In that case, that's the topic for this month, good day.
Doug	Good day, eh?
Bob	Beauty idea for a topic!
Doug	Yeah, good thing I thought of it.
Bob	You? Yeah, right. I thought of it, alone.
Doug	Take off!
